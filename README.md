# Objectives
Python TODO Miniproject Assignment for Python OOP Udemy Course

# Instructions
This is the description provided by the client:

## Requiriments
- [x] The student will be able to create a to-do and assign a description, due date, and priority. 
- [ ] To-dos can be classified as: Personal, Academic, Work, or Leisure.
- [x] The three possible priorities for a to-do are: Urgent, Intermediate, and Optional.
- [ ] To-dos should be removed from the list when the student marks them as complete.
- [ ] The app should also include a list of university courses that the student is taking.
- [ ] Each course should have a code, a professor, a start time, end time, and the classroom assigned.
- [ ] Optionally, the student can assign a classroom and a course to a to-do if it is related to academic activities.

## Tasks

- Analyze the relevant classes for the app and the attributes and methods of each class.
- List the relevant attributes (and, if possible, the potential values) and write a brief description of the functionality of the methods.

You can also add more classes, attributes, and methods beyond the clients' description if you think that they would be relevant for your to-do list app. Write a brief description of why you decided to include them.
